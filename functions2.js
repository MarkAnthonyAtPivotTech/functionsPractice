        Write a function that takes a number and a unit and then converts that number into Celcius or to Fahrenheit depending on the unit

        Ex: passing in 100 and Fahrenheit should return 212
        Ex: passing in 100 and Celcius should return 37.78
        Ex: passing only in 100 should return a string saying: 'Sorry, no unit was specified to convert to'.

    Palindrome Function
