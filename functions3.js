/*
    Highest Number Function (Part 2)
        Write a function that takes in an array of numbers and returns the one number that is the highest number in that array. 
        
        Ex: passing [3,4,6,10,1,300,9] returns 300;

    Filtering for Fives
        Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array that only includes those numbers that are cleanly divisible by 5

        Ex: passing in [100,101,500,503,5] should return [100,500,5]

    Array Sum Function
        Write a function that takes an array of numbers as an argument and returns the sum of all numbers in the array. 
        
        Ex: passing in [1,200,4,0] should return 205.
    
    Unique Elements Function
        Write a function that takes an array of numbers as an argument and returns a new array containing only the unique elements from the original array (no duplicates).

        Ex: passing in [300,300,400,400] should return [300,400]

    Calculate the Total Cost
        Write a function that takes an array of numbers (prices of items) as well as a tax percentage and returns the total cost of a bill.

        Ex: passing in [10,20,30] and 17 should return 70.20 because the tax amount would equal 10.2.
